 the importUserJob method creates a job named "importUserJob" using a JobBuilder. 
 It configures the job to have a unique identifier, a job completion listener, and a single step. 
 The step to be executed is provided as an argument to the method.



JobBuilderFactory and StepBuilderFactory are not exposed as beans in the application context anymore, and are now deprecated for removal in v5.2 in favor of using the respective builders they create.

The typical migration path from v4 to v5 in that regard is as follows:

// Sample with v4
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class MyJobConfig {

    @Autowired
    private JobBuilderFactory jobBuilderFactory;

    @Bean
    public Job myJob(Step step) {
        return this.jobBuilderFactory.get("myJob")
                .start(step)
                .build();
    }

}
// Sample with v5
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class MyJobConfig {

    @Bean
    public Job myJob(JobRepository jobRepository, Step step) {
        return new JobBuilder("myJob", jobRepository)
                .start(step)
                .build();
    }

}
